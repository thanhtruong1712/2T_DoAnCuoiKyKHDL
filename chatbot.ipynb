It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in January 2020 and a pandemic in March 2020. As of 15 January 2021, more than 93.2 million cases have been confirmed, with more than 2 million deaths attributed to COVID-19.\n",
      "\n",
      "Symptoms of COVID-19 are highly variable, ranging from none to severe illness. The virus spreads mainly through the air when people are near each other.[b] It leaves an infected person as they breathe, cough, sneeze, or speak and enters another person via their mouth, nose, or eyes. It may also spread via contaminated surfaces. People remain infectious for up to two weeks, and can spread the virus even if they do not show symptoms.[9]\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommended preventive measures include social distancing, wearing face masks in public, ventilation and air-filtering, hand washing, covering one's mouth when sneezing or coughing, disinfecting surfaces, and monitoring and self-isolation for people exposed or symptomatic. Several vaccines are being developed and distributed. Current treatments focus on addressing symptoms while work is underway to develop therapeutic drugs that inhibit the virus. Authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel restrictions, lockdowns, workplace hazard controls, and facility closures. Many places have also worked to increase testing capacity and trace contacts of the infected.\n",
      "\n",
      "The responses to the pandemic have resulted in global social and economic disruption, including the largest global recession since the Great Depression.[10] It has led to the postponement or cancellation of events, widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic buying, agricultural disruption and food shortages, and decreased emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases. Many educational institutions have been partially or fully closed. Misinformation has circulated through social media and mass media. There have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people and against those perceived as being Chinese or as being from areas with high infection rates.[11]\n",

      "Although it is still unknown exactly where the outbreak first started, many early cases of COVID-19 have been attributed to people who have visited the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, located in Wuhan, Hubei, China.[12] On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease \"COVID-19\", which is short for coronavirus disease 2019.[13][14] The virus that caused the outbreak is known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses,[15] pangolin coronaviruses,[16][17] and SARS-CoV.[18] Scientific consensus is that COVID-19 likely originated naturally, probably from bats.[19][20]\n",
      "\n",
      "The earliest known person with symptoms was later discovered to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019, and that person did not have visible connections with the later wet market cluster.[21][22] However, an earlier case of infection could have occurred on 17 November.[23] Of the early cluster of cases reported that month, two thirds were found to have a link with the market.[24][25][26] There are several theories about when and where the very first case (the so-called patient zero) originated.[27] It is possible that the virus first emerged in October 2019.[28]\n",

      "On 9 April 2020, preliminary results found that 15 percent of people tested in Gangelt, the centre of a major infection cluster in Germany, tested positive for antibodies.[36] Screening for COVID-19 in pregnant women in New York City, and blood donors in the Netherlands, has also found rates of positive antibody tests that may indicate more infections than reported.[37][38] Seroprevalence based estimates are conservative as some studies shown that persons with mild symptoms do not have detectable antibodies.[39] Some results (such as the Gangelt study) have received substantial press coverage without first passing through peer review.[40]\n",
      "\n",
      "Analysis by age in China indicates that a relatively low proportion of cases occur in individuals under 20.[41] It was not clear whether this was because young people were less likely to be infected, or less likely to develop serious symptoms and seek medical attention and be tested.[42] A retrospective cohort study in China found that children and adults were just as likely to be infected.[43]\n",

By mid-May 2020, the effective R was close to or below 1.0 in many countries, meaning the spread of the disease in these areas at that time was stable or decreasing.[46]\n",

      "Official deaths from COVID-19 generally refer to people who died after testing positive according to protocols. This may ignore deaths of people who die without having been tested.[48] Conversely, deaths of people who had underlying conditions may lead to over-counting.[49] Comparison of statistics for deaths for all causes versus the seasonal average indicates excess mortality in many countries.[50][51] This may include deaths due to strained healthcare systems and bans on elective surgery.[52] The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.[53] The first reported death outside of China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines,[54] and the first reported death outside Asia was in the United States on 6 February.[55]\n",

      "More than 95 percent of the people who contract COVID-19 recover. Otherwise, the time between symptoms onset and death usually ranges from 6 to 41 days, typically about 14 days.[56] As of 15 January 2021, more than 2 million[4] deaths had been attributed to COVID-19. People at the greatest risk from COVID-19 tend to be those with underlying conditions, such as a weakened immune system, serious heart or lung problems, severe obesity, or the elderly.[57]\n",

      "On 24 March 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States, indicated the World Health Organization (WHO) had provided two codes for COVID-19: U07.1 when confirmed by laboratory testing and U07.2 for clinically or epidemiological diagnosis where laboratory confirmation is inconclusive or not available.[58][59] The CDC noted that \"Because laboratory test results are not typically reported on death certificates in the U.S., [the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)] is not planning to implement U07.2 for mortality statistics\" and that U07.1 would be used \"If the death certificate reports terms such as 'probable COVID-19' or 'likely COVID-19'.\" The CDC also noted \"It Is not likely that NCHS will follow up on these cases\" and while the \"underlying cause depends upon what and where conditions are reported on the death certificate, ... the rules for coding and selection of the ... cause of death are expected to result in COVID–19 being the underlying cause more often than not.\"[58]\n",
      "\n",
      "On 16 April 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO), in its formal publication of the two codes, U07.1 and U07.2, \"recognized that in many countries detail as to the laboratory confirmation... will not be reported [and] recommended, for mortality purposes only, to code COVID-19 provisionally to code U07.1 unless it is stated as 'probable' or 'suspected'.\"[60][61] It was also noted that the WHO \"does not distinguish\" between infection by SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.[62]\n",

      "\n",
      "A crucial metric in assessing the severity of a disease is the infection fatality ratio (IFR), which is the cumulative number of deaths attributed to the disease divided by the cumulative number of infected individuals (including asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections) as measured or estimated as of a specific date.[70][71][72] Epidemiologists frequently refer to this metric as the 'infection fatality rate' to clarify that it is expressed in percentage points (not as a decimal).[73][74][75] Other published studies refer to this metric as the 'infection fatality risk'.[76][77]\n",
      "\n",
      "In March, a peer-reviewed analysis of pre-serology data from mainland China yielded an overall IFR of 0.66% (with age-bracketed values ranging from 0.00161% for 0–9 years to 0.595% for 50–59 years to 7.8% for > 80 years).[78]\n",
      "\n",
      "In April 2020, an IFR range of 0.12–1.08% was derived from non-peer-reviewed serology surveys, with the upper bound characterized as much more credible and the range indicated as from 3 to 27 times deadlier than influenza (0.04%).[79]\n",
      "\n",
      "In July 2020, the US CDC adopted the IFR as a \"more directly measurable parameter for disease severity for COVID-19\" and computed an overall 'best estimate' for planning purposes for the U.S. of 0.65%.[80][81]\n",
      "\n",
      "In September, the CDC computed an age-bracketed 'best estimate' for the U.S. of 0.003% for 0–19 years; 0.02% for 20–49 years; 0.5% for 50–69 years; and 5.4% for 70+ years.[82][c] The range of CDC estimates for each age group were as follows.[82]\n",

      "\n",
      "In August 2020, the WHO reported serology testing for three locations in Europe (with some data through 2 June) that showed IFR overall estimates converging at approximately 0.5–1%.[71] A systematic review article in The BMJ advised that \"caution is warranted ... using serological tests for ... epidemiological surveillance\" and called for higher quality studies assessing accuracy with reference to a standard of \"RT-PCR performed on at least two consecutive specimens, and, when feasible, includ[ing] viral cultures.\"[83][84] CEBM researchers have called for in-hospital 'case definition' to record \"CT lung findings and associated blood tests\"[85] and for the WHO to produce a \"protocol to standardise the use and interpretation of PCR\" with continuous re-calibration.[86]\n",
      "\n",
      "In September 2020, a Bulletin of the World Health Organization article by John Ioannidis estimated the median global IFR inferred from seroprevalence data at 0.23%[d] overall (with rates of 0.09% in areas with low mortality, and 0.57% in areas with high mortality) and 0.05% for people < 70 years (a range of 0.00–0.31%), much lower than estimates made earlier in the pandemic.[87]\n",
      "\n",
      "On 6 October 2020, Dr. Mike Ryan, director of the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme announced \"Our current best estimates tell us that about 10% of the global population may have been infected by this virus.\"[88] Also in October, the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) reported a 'presumed estimate' of global IFR at between 0.10% to 0.35%, noting that this will vary between populations due to differences in demographics.[89] These researchers noted a decrease in IFR in England over time;[90][e] and, for the UK and Italy (the two Europeans nations worst hit by COVID-19), attribute the rise in daily cases, stability in daily deaths, and shift of cases to a younger population to waning viral circulation, misapplication of testing, and misinterpretation of test results rather than to prevention, treatment, or virus mutation.[91]\n",
      "\n",
      "In November 2020, a review article in Nature reported estimates of population-weighted IFRs for a number of countries, excluding deaths in elderly care facilities, and found a median range of 0.24% to 1.49%.[92]\n",
      "\n",
      "In December 2020, a systematic review and meta-analysis published in the European Journal of Epidemiology estimated that population-weighted IFR was 0.5% to 1% in some countries (France, Netherlands, New Zealand, and Portugal), 1% to 2% in several other countries (Australia, England, Lithuania, and Spain), and about 2.5% in Italy; these estimates included fatalities in elderly care facilities.[93] This study also found that most of the differences in IFR across locations reflected corresponding differences in the age composition of the population and the age-specific pattern of infection rates, due to very low IFRs for children and younger adults (e.g., 0.002% at age 10 and 0.01% at age 25) and progressively higher IFRs for older adults (0.4% at age 55, 1.4% at age 65, 4.6% at age 75, and 15% at age 85).[93] These results were also highlighted in a December 2020 report issued by the World Health Organization.[94]\n",

      "Another metric in assessing death rate is the case fatality ratio (CFR),[f] which is deaths attributed to disease divided by individuals diagnosed to-date. This metric can be misleading because of the delay between symptom onset and death and because testing focuses on individuals with symptoms (and particularly on those manifesting more severe symptoms).[62] On 4 August, WHO indicated \"at this early stage of the pandemic, most estimates of fatality ratios have been based on cases detected through surveillance and calculated using crude methods, giving rise to widely variable estimates of CFR by country – from less than 0.1% to over 25%.\"[71]\n",

      "COVID-19 spreads from person to person mainly through the respiratory route after an infected person coughs, sneezes, sings, talks or breathes. A new infection occurs when virus-containing particles exhaled by an infected person, either respiratory droplets or aerosols, get into the mouth, nose, or eyes of other people who are in close contact with the infected person.[109][110] During human-to-human transmission, an average 1000 infectious SARS-CoV-2 virions are thought to initiate a new infection. The closer people interact, and the longer they interact, the more likely they are to transmit COVID-19. Closer distances can involve larger droplets (which fall to the ground) and aerosols, whereas longer distances only involve aerosols. The larger droplets may also evaporate into the aerosols (known as droplet nuclei). The relative importance of the larger droplets and the aerosols is not clear as of November 2020, however the virus is not known to transmit between rooms over long distances such as through air ducts. Airborne transmission is able to particularly occur indoors, in high risk locations, such as in restaurants, choirs, gyms, nightclubs, offices, and religious venues, often when they are crowded or less ventilated. It also occurs in healthcare settings, often when aerosol-generating medical procedures are performed on COVID-19 patients. The number of people generally infected by one infected person varies; as of September 2020 it was estimated that one infected person will, on average, infect between two and three other people.[111] This is more infectious than [112] It often spreads in The number of people generally infected by one infected person varies; as of September 2020 it was estimated that one infected person will, on average, infect between two and three other people.This is more infectious than influenza , but less so than measles It often spreads in clusters , where infections can be traced back to an index case or geographical location.

In 3-4% of cases (7.4% for those over age 65) symptoms are severe enough to cause hospitalization.[171] Mild cases typically recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to recover. Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to eight weeks.[172] The Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità reported that the median time between the onset of symptoms and death was twelve days, with seven being hospitalised. However, people transferred to an ICU had a median time of ten days between hospitalisation and death.[173] Prolonged prothrombin time and elevated C-reactive protein levels on admission to the hospital are associated with severe course of COVID-19 and with a transfer to ICU.[174][175] Some early studies suggest 10% to 20% of people with COVID-19 will experience [176][177] A majority of those who were admitted to hospital with severe disease report long-term problems including fatigue and shortness of breath.[178] On 30 October 2020 WHO chief [179] Some early studies suggest 10% to 20% of people with COVID-19 will experience symptoms lasting longer than a month A majority of those who were admitted to hospital with severe disease report long-term problems including fatigue and shortness of breath.On 30 October 2020 WHO chief Tedros Adhanom has warned that \"to a significant number of people, the COVID virus poses a range of serious long-term effects\". He has described the vast spectrum of COVID-19 symptoms that fluctuate over time as \"really concerning.\" They range from fatigue, a cough and shortness of breath, to inflammation and injury of major organs – including the lungs and heart, and also neurological and psychologic effects. Symptoms often overlap and can affect any system in the body. Infected people have reported cyclical bouts of fatigue, headaches, months of complete exhaustion, mood swings, and other symptoms.

      "Strategies in the control of an outbreak are screening, containment (or suppression), and mitigation. Screening is done with a device such as a thermometer to detect the elevated body temperature associated with fevers caused by the coronavirus.[186] Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures to stop the disease from spreading. When it is no longer possible to contain the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.[187] Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproduction number to less than 1.[188]\n",
      "\n",
      "Part of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to delay and decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.[182] This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.[182] Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.[189]\n",

      "More drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.[190] Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised the hoarding of medical supplies.[191]\n",

      "Simulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges. Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems. Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.[188]\n",

Concerns have been raised over the effectiveness of travel restrictions to contain the spread of COVID-19.[488] A study in Science found that travel restrictions had only modestly affected the initial spread of COVID-19, unless combined with infection prevention and control measures to considerably reduce transmissions.[489] Researchers concluded that \"travel restrictions are most useful in the early and late phase of an epidemic\" and \"restrictions of travel from Wuhan unfortunately came too late\".[490]\n",

in Wuhan, China.', 'The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in January 2020 and a pandemic in March 2020.', 'As of 15 January 2021, more than 93.2 million cases have been confirmed, with more than 2 million deaths attributed to COVID-19.', 'Symptoms of COVID-19 are highly variable, ranging from none to severe illness.', 'The virus

'It may also spread via contaminated surfaces.', 'People remain infectious for up to two weeks, and can spread the virus even if they do not show symptoms.', \"[9]\\n\\nRecommended preventive measures include social distancing, wearing face masks in public, ventilation and air-filtering, hand washing, covering one's mouth when sneezing or coughing, disinfecting surfaces, and monitoring and

therapeutic drugs that inhibit the virus.', 'Authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel restrictions, lockdowns, workplace hazard controls, and facility closures.', 'Many places have also worked to increase testing capacity and trace contacts of the infected.', 'The responses to the pandemic have resulted in global social and economic disruption, including the largest global recession since the Great Depression.', '[10] It has led to the postponement or cancellation of events, widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic buying, agricultural disruption and food shortages, and decreased emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases.', 'Many educational institutions have been partially or fully closed.', 'Misinformation has circulated through social media and mass media.', 'There have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people and against those perceived as being Chinese or as being from areas with high infection rates.', '[11]\\n\\nEpidemiology\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nAlthough it is still unknown exactly where the outbreak first started, many early cases of COVID-19 have been attributed to people who have visited the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, located in Wuhan, Hubei, China.', '[12] On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease \"COVID-19\", which is short for coronavirus disease 2019.', '[13][14] The virus that caused the outbreak is known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses,[15] pangolin coronaviruses,[16][17] and SARS-CoV.', '[18] Scientific consensus is that COVID-19 likely originated naturally, probably from bats.', '[19][20]\\n\\nThe earliest known person with symptoms was later discovered to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019, and that person did not have visible connections with the later wet market cluster.', '[21][22] However, an earlier case of infection could have occurred on 17 November.', '[23] Of the early cluster of cases reported that month, two thirds were found to have a link with the market.', '[24][25][26] There are several theories about when and where the very first case (the so-called patient zero) originated.', '[27] It is possible that the virus first emerged in October 2019.', '[28]\\n\\nCases\\n\\n10,000,000+\\n\\n1,000,000–9,999,999\\n\\n100,000–999,999\\n\\n10,000–99,999\\n\\n1,000–9,999\\n\\n100–999\\n\\n1–99\\n\\n0 Total confirmed cases per country as of 9 January 2021.', 'Official case counts refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.', '[29][30] Many countries, early on, had official policies to not test those with only mild symptoms.', '[31][32] An analysis of the early phase of the outbreak up to 23 January estimated 86 percent of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these undocumented infections were the source for 79 percent of documented cases.', '[33] Several other studies, using a variety of methods, have estimated that numbers of infections in many countries are likely to be considerably greater than the reported cases.', '[34][35]\\n\\nOn 9 April 2020, preliminary results found that 15 percent of people tested in Gangelt, the centre of a major infection cluster in Germany, tested positive for antibodies.', '[36] Screening for COVID-19 in pregnant women in New York City, and blood donors in the Netherlands, has also found rates of positive antibody tests that may indicate more infections than reported.', '[37][38] Seroprevalence based estimates are conservative as some studies shown that persons with mild symptoms do not have detectable antibodies.', '[39] Some results (such as the Gangelt study) have received substantial press coverage without first passing through peer review.', '[40]\\n\\nAnalysis by age in China indicates that a relatively low proportion of cases occur in individuals under 20.', '[41] It was not clear whether this was because young people were less likely to be infected, or less likely to develop serious symptoms and seek medical attention and be tested.', '[42] A retrospective cohort study in China found that children and adults were just as likely to be infected.', '[43]\\n\\nInitial estimates of the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) for COVID-19 in January were between 1.4 and 2.5,[44] but a subsequent analysis concluded that it may be about 5.7 (with a 95 percent confidence interval of 3.8 to 8.9).', '[45] R 0 can vary across populations and is not to be confused with the effective reproduction number (commonly just called R), which takes into account effects such as social distancing and herd immunity.', 'By mid-May 2020, the effective R was close to or below 1.0 in many countries, meaning the spread of the disease in these areas at that time was stable or decreasing.', '[46]\\n\\nEpidemic curve of daily new cases of COVID-19 (7 day rolling average) by continent\\n\\nSemi-log plot of weekly new cases of COVID-19 in the world and top five

countries[47]\\n\\nDeaths\\n\\nOfficial deaths from COVID-19 generally refer to people who died after testing positive according to protocols.', 'This may ignore deaths of people who die without having been tested.', '[48] Conversely, deaths of people who had underlying conditions may lead to over-counting.', '[49] Comparison of statistics for deaths for all causes versus the seasonal average indicates excess mortality in many countries.', '[50][51] This may include deaths due to strained healthcare systems and bans on elective surgery.', '[52] The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.', '[53] The first reported death outside of China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines,[54] and the first reported death outside Asia was in the United States on 6 February.', '[55]\\n\\nMore than 95 percent of the people who contract COVID-19 recover.', 'Otherwise, the time between symptoms onset and death usually ranges from 6 to 41 days, typically about 14 days.', '[56] As of 15 January 2021, more than 2 million[4] deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.', 'People at the greatest risk from COVID-19 tend to be those with underlying conditions, such as a weakened immune system, serious heart or lung problems, severe obesity, or the elderly.', '[57]\\n\\nOn 24 March 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States, indicated the World Health Organization (WHO) had provided two codes for COVID-19: U07.1 when confirmed by laboratory testing and U07.2 for clinically or epidemiological diagnosis where laboratory confirmation is inconclusive or not available.', '[58][59] The CDC noted that \"Because laboratory test results are not typically reported on death certificates in the U.S., [the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)] is not planning to implement U07.2 for mortality statistics\" and that U07.1 would be used \"If the death certificate reports terms such as \\'probable COVID-19\\' or \\'likely COVID-19\\'.\"', 'The CDC also noted \"It Is not likely that NCHS will follow up on these cases\" and while the \"underlying cause depends upon what and where conditions are reported on the death certificate, ... the rules for coding and selection of the ... cause of death are expected to result in COVID–19 being the underlying cause more often than not.', '\"[58]\\n\\nOn 16 April 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO), in its formal publication of the two codes, U07.1 and U07.2, \"recognized that in many countries detail as to the laboratory confirmation... will not be reported [and] recommended, for mortality purposes only, to code COVID-19 provisionally to code U07.1 unless it is stated as \\'probable\\' or \\'suspected\\'.', '\"[60][61] It was also noted that the WHO \"does not distinguish\" between infection by SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.', '[62]\\n\\nMultiple measures are used to quantify mortality.', '[63] These numbers vary by region and over time, influenced by testing volume, healthcare system quality, treatment options, government response,[64][65][66] time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics, such as age, sex, and overall health.', '[67] Countries like Belgium include deaths from suspected cases of COVID-19, regardless of whether the person was tested, resulting in higher numbers compared to countries that include only test-confirmed cases.', '[68]\\n\\nThe death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval.', 'Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 2.1 percent (2,000,905 deaths for 93,275,676 cases) as of 15 January 2021.', '[4] The number varies by region.', '[69]\\n\\nSemi-log plot of weekly deaths due to COVID-19 in the world and top five current countries (mean with cases)\\n\\nCOVID-19 deaths per 100 000 population from selected countries[47]\\n\\nInfection fatality ratio (IFR)\\n\\nA crucial metric in assessing the severity of a disease is the infection fatality ratio (IFR), which is the cumulative number of deaths attributed to the disease divided by the cumulative number of infected individuals (including asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections) as measured or estimated as of a specific date.', \"[70][71][72] Epidemiologists frequently refer to this metric as the 'infection fatality rate' to clarify that it is expressed in percentage points (not as a decimal).\", \"[73][74][75] Other published studies refer to this metric as the 'infection fatality risk'.\", '[76][77]\\n\\nIn March, a peer-reviewed analysis of pre-serology data from mainland China yielded an overall IFR of 0.66% (with age-bracketed values ranging from 0.00161% for 0–9 years to 0.595% for 50–59 years to 7.8% for > 80 years).', '[78]\\n\\nIn April 2020, an IFR range of 0.12–1.08% was derived from non-peer-reviewed serology surveys, with the upper bound characterized as much more credible and the range indicated as from 3 to 27 times deadlier than influenza (0.04%).', '[79]\\n\\nIn July 2020, the US CDC adopted the IFR as a \"more directly measurable parameter for disease severity for COVID-19\" and computed an overall \\'best estimate\\' for planning purposes for the U.S. of 0.65%.', \"[80][81]\\n\\nIn September, the CDC computed an age-bracketed 'best estimate' for the U.S. of 0.003% for 0–19 years; 0.02% for 20–49 years; 0.5% for 50–69 years; and 5.4% for 70+ years.\", '[82][c] The range of CDC estimates for each age group were as follows.', '[82]\\n\\nCDC Planning Scenario IFR Range Age group IFR 0–19 0.002%–0.01% 20–49 0.007%–0.03% 50–69 0.25%–1.0% 70+ 2.8%–9.3%\\n\\nIn August 2020, the WHO reported serology testing for three locations in Europe (with some data through 2 June) that showed IFR overall estimates converging at approximately 0.5–1%.', '[71] A systematic review article in The BMJ advised that \"caution is warranted ... using serological tests for ... epidemiological surveillance\" and called for higher quality studies assessing accuracy with reference to a standard of \"RT-PCR performed on at least two consecutive specimens, and, when feasible, includ[ing] viral cultures.', '\"[83][84] CEBM researchers have called for in-hospital \\'case definition\\' to record \"CT lung findings and associated blood tests\"[85] and for the WHO to produce a \"protocol to standardise the use and interpretation of PCR\" with continuous re-calibration.', '[86]\\n\\nIn September 2020, a Bulletin of the World Health Organization article by John Ioannidis estimated the median global IFR inferred from seroprevalence data at 0.23%[d] overall (with rates of 0.09% in areas with low mortality, and 0.57% in areas with high mortality) and 0.05% for people < 70 years (a range of 0.00–0.31%), much lower than estimates made earlier in the pandemic.', '[87]\\n\\nOn 6 October 2020, Dr. Mike Ryan, director of the WHO\\'s Health Emergencies Programme announced \"Our current best estimates tell us that about 10% of the global population may have been infected by this virus.', '\"[88] Also in October, the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) reported a \\'presumed estimate\\' of global IFR at between 0.10% to 0.35%, noting that this will vary between populations due to differences in demographics.', '[89] These researchers noted a decrease in IFR in England over time;[90][e] and, for the UK and Italy (the two Europeans nations worst hit by COVID-19), attribute the rise in daily cases, stability in daily deaths, and shift of cases to a younger population to waning viral circulation, misapplication of testing, and misinterpretation of test results rather than to prevention, treatment, or virus mutation.', '[91]\\n\\nIn November 2020, a review article in Nature reported estimates of population-weighted IFRs for a number of countries, excluding deaths in elderly care facilities, and found a median range of 0.24% to 1.49%.', '[92]\\n\\nIn December 2020, a systematic review and meta-analysis published in the European Journal of Epidemiology estimated that population-weighted IFR was 0.5% to 1% in some countries (France, Netherlands, New Zealand, and Portugal), 1% to 2% in several other countries (Australia, England, Lithuania, and Spain), and about 2.5% in Italy; these estimates included fatalities in elderly care facilities.', '[93] This study also found that most of the differences in IFR across locations reflected corresponding differences in the age composition of the population and the age-specific pattern of infection rates, due to very low IFRs for children and younger adults (e.g., 0.002% at age 10 and 0.01% at age 25) and progressively higher IFRs for older adults (0.4% at age 55, 1.4% at age 65, 4.6% at age 75, and 15% at age 85).', '[93] These results were also highlighted in a December 2020 report issued by the World Health Organization.', '[94]\\n\\nCase fatality ratio (CFR)\\n\\nAnother metric in assessing death rate is the case fatality ratio (CFR),[f] which is deaths attributed to disease divided by individuals diagnosed to-date.', 'This metric can be misleading because of the delay between symptom onset and death and because testing focuses on individuals with symptoms (and particularly on those manifesting more severe symptoms).', '[62] On 4 August, WHO indicated \"at this early stage of the pandemic, most estimates of fatality ratios have been based on cases detected through surveillance and calculated using crude methods, giving rise to widely variable estimates of CFR by country – from less than 0.1% to over 25%.', '\"[71]\\n\\nDisease\\n\\nSigns and symptoms\\n\\nTransmission\\n\\nCOVID-19 spreads from person to person mainly through the respiratory route after an infected person coughs, sneezes, sings, talks or breathes.', 'A new infection occurs when virus-containing particles exhaled by an infected person, either respiratory droplets or aerosols, get into the mouth, nose, or eyes of other people who are in close contact with the infected person.', '[109][110] During human-to-human transmission, an average 1000 infectious SARS-CoV-2 virions are thought to initiate a new infection.', 'The closer people interact, and the longer they interact, the more likely they are to transmit COVID-19.', 'Closer distances can involve larger droplets (which fall to the ground) and aerosols, whereas longer distances only involve aerosols.', 'The larger droplets may also evaporate into the aerosols (known as droplet nuclei).', 'The relative importance of the larger droplets and the aerosols is not clear as of November 2020, however the virus is not known to transmit between rooms over long distances such as through air ducts.', 'Airborne transmission is able to particularly occur indoors, in high risk locations, such as in restaurants, choirs, gyms, nightclubs, offices, and religious venues, often when they are crowded or less ventilated.', 'It also occurs in healthcare settings, often when aerosol-generating medical procedures are performed on COVID-19 patients.', 'The number of people generally infected by one

(or suppression), and mitigation.', 'Screening is done with a device such as a thermometer to detect the elevated body temperature associated with fevers caused by the coronavirus.', '[186] Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures to stop the disease from spreading.', 'When it is no longer possible to contain the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society.', 'A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.', '[187] Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproduction number to less than 1.', '[188]\\n\\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to delay and decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.', '[182] This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.', '[182] Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.', '[189]\\n\\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.', '[190] Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.', 'South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals.',

the World Food Programme (WFP), said \"we could be facing multiple famines of biblical proportions within a short few months.', '\"[547] Senior officials at the United Nations estimated in April 2020

negative and fell to a record low (minus $37.63 a barrel) due to traders' offloading holdings so as not to take delivery and incur storage costs.\", '[551] June prices were down but in the positive range, with a barrel of West Texas trading above $20.', \"[551]\\n\\nCulture\\n\\nThe performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been profoundly affected by the pandemic, impacting organisations' operations as well as individuals—both employed and independent—globally.\", 'Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists where possible.', 'By March 2020, across the world and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, performance venues, and other cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed with their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.', '[552] In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms.', '[553][554][555]\\n\\nHoly Week observances in Rome, which occur during the last week of the Christian penitential season of Lent, were cancelled.', '[554] Many dioceses have recommended older Christians stay home rather than attend Mass on Sundays; services have been made available via radio, online live streaming and television, though some congregations have made provisions for drive-in worship.', \"[556][557][554] With the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closing its churches and chapels and St. Peter's Square emptied of Christian pilgrims,[554] other religious bodies also cancelled in-person services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.\", \"[554] Iran's Health Ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and shrines were later closed,[308][315] while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its residents to holy sites in Mecca and Medina.\", '[558][559] The 2020 Hajj was limited to around 1,000 selected pilgrims, in contrast to the usual number of over 2 million.', '[560]\\n\\nThe pandemic has caused the most significant disruption to the worldwide sporting calendar since the Second World War.', 'Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League,[561] 2019–20 Premier League,[562] UEFA Euro 2020, 2019–20 NBA season,[563] and 2019–20 NHL season.', '[564] The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, which were originally scheduled to start at 24 July 2020, and were postponed by the International Olympic Committee to 23 July 2021.', '[565][566]\\n\\nThe entertainment industry has also been affected, with many music groups suspending or cancelling concert tours.', '[568][569] The Eurovision Song Contest, which was due to be held in Rotterdam, the Netherlands in May, was cancelled; however, the Netherlands was retained as host for 2021.', '[570][571] Many large theatres such as those on Broadway also suspended all performances.', '[572] Some artists have explored ways to continue to produce and share work over the internet as an alternative to traditional live performance, such as live streaming concerts[573] or creating web-based \"festivals\" for artists to perform, distribute, and publicise their work.', '[574]\\n\\nThe large number of people working or learning from home via videoconferencing software led to several new terms and trends, including \"zoom fatigue\",[575] a decline in demand for formal clothing, and increased fashion focus on masks and clothes for the upper body (the lower body generally not being visible on a videoconference).', '[576] The term \"doomscrolling\" became more widely used.', 'Online, numerous COVID-19-themed Internet memes have spread as many turn to humour and distraction amid the uncertainty.', '[577] A popular Twitter account called \"Room Rater\" jokingly commented on and assigned numerical scores to the backgrounds of journalists and others appearing in mass media from home.', '[578]\\n\\nPolitics\\n\\nThe pandemic has affected the political systems of multiple countries, causing suspensions of legislative activities,[579] isolations or deaths of multiple politicians,[580] and rescheduling of elections due to fears of spreading the virus.', '[581] Starting in late May, large-scale protests against police brutality in at least 200 U.S. cities and later worldwide in response to the killing of George Floyd raised concerns of a resurgence of the virus.', '[582]\\n\\nAlthough they have broad support among epidemiologists, social distancing measures have been politically controversial in many countries.', 'Intellectual opposition to social distancing has come primarily from writers of other fields, although there are a few heterodox epidemiologists.', '[583]\\n\\nOn 23 March 2020, United Nations Secretary-General António Manuel de Oliveira Guterres issued an appeal for a global ceasefire in response to the pandemic;[584][585] 172 UN Member States and Observers signed a non-binding statement in support of the appeal in June,[586] and the UN Security Council passed a resolution supporting it in July.', '[587][588]\\n\\nChina\\n\\nThe government of China has been criticised by the United States,[589] the UK Minister for the Cabinet Office Michael Gove,[590] and others[591] for its handling of the pandemic.', 'A number of provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China were dismissed over their handling of the quarantine measures in China, a sign of discontent with their response to the outbreak.', 'Some commentators believed this move was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping from the controversy.', '[592] The U.S. intelligence community claims China intentionally under-reported its number of coronavirus cases.', '[593] The Chinese government maintains it has acted swiftly and transparently.', '[594][595]\\n\\nItaly\\n\\nIn early March, the Italian government criticised the European Union\\'s lack of solidarity with coronavirus-affected Italy[596][597]—Maurizio Massari, Italy\\'s ambassador to the EU, said \"only China responded bilaterally\", not the EU.', '[598] On 22 March, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian president Vladimir Putin had the Russian army send military medics, disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.', '[599] President of Lombardy Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio expressed their gratitude for the aid.', '[600] Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical aid to the United States.', '[601] Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said \"when offering assistance to U.S. colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when U.S. manufacturers of medical equipment and materials gain momentum, they will also be able to reciprocate if necessary.', '\"[602] In early April, Norway and EU states like Romania and Austria started to offer help by sending medical personnel and disinfectant,[603] and Ursula von der Leyen offered an official apology to the country.', '[604]\\n\\nUnited States\\n\\nThe outbreak prompted calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other wealthy countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid sick leave, and higher levels of funding for public health.', \"[606][607][608] Political analysts believe it may have contributed to Donald Trump's loss in the 2020 presidential election.\", '[609][610] Beginning in mid-April 2020, there were protests in several U.S. states against government-imposed business closures and restricted personal movement and association.', '[611] Simultaneously, protests ensued by essential workers in the form of a general strike.', \"[612] In early October 2020, U.S. president Donald Trump, his family members, and many other government officials were diagnosed with COVID-19, further disrupting the country's politics.\", '[613]\\n\\nOther countries\\n\\nThe planned NATO \"Defender 2020\" military exercise in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, the largest NATO war exercise since the end of the Cold War, was held on a reduced scale.', '[614][615] The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament\\'s general secretary Kate Hudson criticised the exercise, saying \"it jeopardises the lives not only of the troops from the U.S. and the many European countries participating but the inhabitants of the countries in which they are operating.', '\"[616]\\n\\nThe Iranian government has been heavily affected by the virus, with about two dozen parliament members and fifteen current or former political figures infected.', \"[318][617] Iran's President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help on 14 March 2020, saying they were struggling to fight the outbreak due to a lack of access to international markets from the United States sanctions against Iran.\", '[618] Saudi Arabia, which launched a military intervention in Yemen in March 2015, declared a ceasefire.', '[619]\\n\\nDiplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened due to the pandemic.', '[620] South Korea criticised Japan\\'s \"ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts\" after Japan announced anyone coming from South Korea would be placed in quarantine for two weeks at government-designated sites.', \"[621] South Korean society was initially polarised on President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis; many Koreans signed petitions either calling for Moon's impeachment or praising his response.\", '[341]\\n\\nSome countries have passed emergency legislation in response to the pandemic.', 'Some commentators have expressed concern that it could allow governments to strengthen their grip on power.', '[622][623] In the Philippines, lawmakers granted president Rodrigo Duterte temporary emergency powers during the pandemic.', \"[624] In Hungary, the parliament voted to allow the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament as well as elections, and punish those deemed to have spread false information about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis.\", '[625] In some countries, including Egypt,[626] Turkey,[627] and Thailand,[624] opposition activists and government critics have been arrested for allegedly spreading fake news about the COVID-19 pandemic.', '[628]\\n\\nAgriculture and food systems\\n\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted agricultural and food systems worldwide.', '[629] COVID-19 hit at a time when hunger or undernourishment was once again on the rise in the world, with an estimated 690 million people already going hungry in 2019.', '[630] Based on the latest UN estimates, the economic recession triggered by the pandemic may lead to another 83 million people, and possibly as many as 132 million, going hungry in 2020.', '[630][631][632][633] This is mainly due to a lack of access to food – linked to falling incomes, lost remittances and, in some cases, a rise in food prices.', 'In countries that already suffer from high levels of acute food insecurity, it is no longer an issue of access to food alone, but increasingly also one of food production.', '[629][630]\\n\\nThe pandemic, alongside lockdowns and travel restrictions, has prevented movement of aid and greatly impacted food production.', 'As a result, several famines are forecast, which the United Nations called a crisis \"of biblical proportions,\"[634] or \"hunger pandemic.', '\"[635] It is estimated that without intervention 30 million people may die of hunger, with Oxfam reporting that \"12,000 people per day could die from COVID-19 linked hunger\" by the end of 2020.', '[636][634][637] This pandemic, in conjunction with the 2019–20 locust infestations and several ongoing armed conflicts, is predicted to form the worst series of famines since the Great Chinese Famine, affecting between 10 and 20 percent of the global population in some way.', '[638] 55 countries are reported to be at risk, with three dozen succumbing to crisis-level famines or above in the worst-case scenario.', '[639] 265 million people are forecast to be in famine conditions, an increase of 125 million due to the coronavirus pandemic.', '[636]\\n\\nEducation\\n\\nOther health issues\\n\\nEnvironment and climate\\n\\nXenophobia and racism\\n\\nSince the start of the outbreak, heightened prejudice, xenophobia, and racism have been documented around the world toward people of Chinese and East Asian descent.', \"[669][670][671] Reports from February (when most cases were confined to China) documented racist sentiments expressed in groups worldwide about Chinese people 'deserving' the virus.\", '[672][673][674] Chinese people and other Asian in the United Kingdom and United States have reported increasing levels of racist abuse and assaults.', '[675][676][677] U.S. President Donald Trump has been criticised for referring to the coronavirus as the \"Chinese Virus\" and \"Kung Flu\", which has been widely condemned as racist and xenophobic.', '[678][679][680] On 14 March, an Asian family, including a two-year-old girl, was attacked at knifepoint in Texas in what the FBI has called a COVID-19 related hate crime.', '[681]\\n\\nFollowing the progression of the outbreak to new hotspot countries, people from Italy (the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19) were also subjected to suspicion and xenophobia,[682][683] as were people from hotspots in other countries.', \"Discrimination against Muslims in India escalated after public health authorities identified an Islamic missionary (Tablighi Jamaat) group's gathering in New Delhi in early March 2020 as a source of spread.\", '[684] Paris has seen riots break out over police treatment of ethnic minorities during the coronavirus lockdown.', '[685] Racism and xenophobia towards southern and south east Asians increased in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf.', \"[686][687][688] South Korea's LGBTQ community was blamed by some for the spread of COVID-19 in Seoul.\", '[689][690] In China, some people of African descent were evicted from their homes and told to leave China within 24 hours, due to disinformation that they and other foreigners were spreading the virus.', '[691] This racism and xenophobia was criticised by foreign governments and diplomatic corps and the Chinese ambassador to Zimbabwe.', '[692]\\n\\nInformation dissemination\\n\\nOngoing COVID-19 research is indexed and searchable in the NIH COVID-19 Portfolio.', '[693] Some newspaper agencies removed their online paywalls for some or all of their coronavirus-related articles and posts,[694] while scientific publishers made scientific papers related to the outbreak available with open access.', '[695][696] Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.', '[697]\\n\\nMisinformation\\n\\nSee
